        Hi, I'm <span className="font-semibold text-purple-800">Omkar </span>, 
        and I built this application to help people track and manage their finances 
        in a simple, easy-to-use way. My goal was to create a clean interface 
        where users can quickly add, view, and organize their transactions.

        This project was developed using <span className="font-medium">React</span>, 
        <span className="font-medium"> Tailwind CSS</span>, <span className="font-medium"> Springboot</span> and 
        <span className="font-medium"> MySQL</span> on the backend.  
        Iâ€™ve also added features like secure authentication and profile management.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Special thanks to my mentors, friends, and everyone who tested the app 
        and gave feedback.  
        I hope this project helps you take better control of your money.
